      <h2 id="developers-versus-seos">Developers versus SEOs</h2>

<p>There is a large mentality that search engine optimization and website development are mutually
exclusive.  I also had this mentality until about 4 months ago when I was assigned to going through a
poorly produced spreadsheet full of tips and suggestions from an SEO company that I will not name
for the sake of not angering anyone, but let me strongly recommend that if you are an SEO and you’re
producing a spreadsheet report for you client, please take out the columns that mention “Suggest product
 X to client, we get a kickback.”  That’s a tip you can have for free.</p>

<p>Before this I had never really paid much attention to SEO and I was in the same school of thought that
most developers were in that mainly consisted of assuming that SEOs were nothing but prognosticators who gave
little helpful information.  After my experience with the company that gave us the ad based spreadsheet, I was
certain that the crystal ball method of SEO was the case.  I suggested to my boss that maybe we start baking the SEO
into the code of the sites, because there’s no way it could be that hard.</p>

<p>It turned out that I was just dealing with an incopmpetent SEO company who had only the significant amount of money
we were paying them in mind as opposed to giving advice we could use or even better, tell us that we’re doing
a good job.  I’d rather hear that there were minimal changes to be made than have stuff made up and placed in
a very poorly designed presentation with poor communication afterwards.  This helped to cement my web developer
mentality that SEOs were nothing but prognositcators who preyed on websites with money.</p>

<p>This past week I attended a <strong>HUGE</strong> conference and training for search engine marketing and
search engine optimization that was kicked off by a workshop by Bruce Clay (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/bruceclayinc">@BruceClayInc</a>)
and from the beginning of the presentation I was convinced that I was wrong.  There was an unbelieveable amount of work,
research, and study put into every aspect of cracking the infamous Google Algorithm and keeping
clients’ sites towards the top of the Search Engine Results Page (SERP) that I would have never imagined.
What was originally an excuse to go to California for a week suddenly became unbelieveably exciting to me.
I wanted to know more.</p>

<h2 id="donuts-and-the-art-of-networking">Donuts and the Art of Networking</h2>

<p>Fortune smiled upon me in the form of a single tweet.</p>
<div class="embed twitter"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">hey <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/smx?src=hash">#smx</a> - wanna have your mind blown by the best donuts EVER? Meet in the Mariott lobby at 8am, we&#39;ll head over to <a href="https://twitter.com/psychodonuts">@psychodonuts</a></p>&mdash; Greg Gifford (@GregGifford) <a href="https://twitter.com/GregGifford/status/572602658692853760">March 3, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

<p>As a lover of donuts, and since I had already planned on going to Psycho Donuts, I decided to join Greg and whoever
else was going with in the donut caravan, and my week got a lot more interesting.  At the time I did not realize
that I was going to be enjoying breakfast with some of the speakers of Search Marketing Expo, but a few seconds into
my S’moreo Donut (freaking delicious!) I made the connection and latched on to Greg and Grant Tilus
(<a href="https://www.twitter.com/granttilus">@granttilus</a>) like a lamprey.</p>

<p>By following them around, connecting to their connections, and observing conversations, I learned more
than I thought possible, and probably got more out of the conference than most people just by responding to a single tweet.
I managed to get invited to an event by Point It Digital Marketing (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/point_it">@point_it</a>), followed by
Janes of Digital presented by Bing Ads (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/bingads">@bingads</a>) and some wonderful dinners
with some of the greatest minds at Search Marketing Expo including, but not limited to Steve Hammer
(<a href="http://www.twitter.com/armondhammer">@armondhammer</a>), Jenny Halasz (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/jennyhalasz">@jennyhalasz</a>),
John Lee (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/john_a_lee">@john_a_lee</a>), Mark Traphagen (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/marktraphagen">@marktraphagen</a>),
Brett Snyder (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/brettasnyder">@brettasnyder</a>), and Larry Kim (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/larrykim">@larrykim</a>).  The strange thing was that in the
several hundred people that attended Search Marketing Expo West, I was one of probably less than 10 developers, or at
least people whose title is “Web Developer” and that led me to get some pretty interesting question, the most common being,
“Why are you here?”</p>

<h2 id="bridging-the-gap">Bridging the Gap</h2>

<p>Why was I there?  For starters, to go to California in the middle of a cold Chicago winter, but more importantly, I was originally
there to prove that SEO was all smoke and mirrors.  With my opinion having done a complete turn around, I was now there to learn
if it was possible to bridge the gap between development and SEO, preferably by injecting SEO into the development process, and I
was met with praise of the highest order.</p>

<p>“Finally!” many SEOs would exclaim.  “It’s usually a nightmare to get the developers to do anything we ask them to do.”  They
gave me some examples and told me how developers would quote them at days, if not weeks, to complete a simple request that,
as a developer and even without knowing the system that they were using, I could quote a matter of hours.  If it really
did take the dev team that long, then I’m either a phenominal developer, or their teams are either a) Lazy or b) Unskilled.
To be honest, it could be either of those since I know I’m not a phenominal developer.</p>

<p>Now that I know SEO and web development can go hand in hand, I am going to do what I can to use best SEO practices in every
bit of code that I write and learn as much as I can about becoming a quality SEO in the process, and maybe, just maybe, branch out into
the wild, wild world of search engine optimization.</p>
