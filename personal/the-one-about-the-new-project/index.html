      <p>It’s easy to get sucked into work and not find a creative outlet.  Even if our work as developers is generally creative, we can easily get lost in it and, in doing so, quickly lose our passion for anything.  I ran into this problem a few months ago and decided that I needed something new to do, so I asked myself what was something that didn’t directly involve coding that I enjoyed and I kept coming back to one thing.</p>

<h2 id="i-decided-to-start-a-podcast">I decided to start a podcast!</h2>

<p>So, I had the idea, but I didn’t have a plan.  Not many good podcasts that I’ve listened to had a single host and I’m well aware that I’m not entertaining enough to get anyone to listen and I didn’t want my podcast to fall on deaf ears, so I began my search for a cohost.</p>

<p>Minutes turned into hours.  Hours into days.  Days into weeks.  Weeks into… more weeks, but not quite months.  I eventually talked my friends Bill and Mike into joining my adventure with promises of nothing but a chance to talk about the things we enjoy.  Basically all things nerd and geek culture on a semi-regular basis with the opportunity to be heard by literally 3 or more people who weren’t us.  Of course they jumped on board!  Who wouldn’t?</p>

<p>We decided, very early on, that we were going to be doing this podcast for us and for only us.  Our target audience from day 1 was people like us.  Getting someone else to think like us is hard, but getting someone who already thinks like you to enjoy something you enjoy is much easier.  During the short time that I worked for an ad agency, I learned a story about a fast food chain who wanted to make more money so they tried to start marketing to people who wanted to be healthier with healthier foods.</p>

<p>This chain started selling salads and wondered why nobody was buying them.  It turns out that convincing <em>anyone</em> that a fast food chain can be healthy is difficult.  What’s easier?  Getting the people who already go there to buy more.</p>

<p>Our target audience asks a simple question that we aimed to answer:</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-good-podcast-about-nerd-or-geek-culture">What is a good podcast about nerd or geek culture?</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.meanwhileattemple.com">Meanwhile at Temple</a></strong> is a podcast about movies, games, pop culture, nerd and geek culture, and all things that interest nerds and geeks.  We find a topic that we know we can talk about at length and press record.  So far, at the time of this writing, we have one episode “in the can” (I feel like a pro saying that) and we’re on track to make it weekly.</p>

<p>While it’s not the perfect outlet, we are all having a lot of fun doing it and I am thoroughly enjoying learning about the technical aspects of podcasting including the hosting and syndication.</p>

<p>If you want to have a listen to <a href="https://www.meanwhileattemple.com">Meanwhile at Temple</a> you can find us on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/meanwhile-at-temple/id1284777556#">iTunes</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ioqhv43se72ljq4nhlpkkfx2dce?t=Meanwhile_at_Temple">Google Play Music</a> or on any podcast players that syndicate the iTunes feeds.</p>

<p>Have a listen and let me know what you think.  If you like it, tell a friend.  If you don’t, then tell me.</p>

<p>What would you like to hear us talk about in a future episode?  Let me know in the comments.</p>
